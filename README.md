# NCEES Daily Challenges

This repository will be used as a submission platform for the NCEES community.

## What's here
Each folder in / represents a challenge, which will contain it's own README.md explaining the task at hand. 

A new challenge should be added each week!

## Submissions
To submit your work (in whatever language you desire), simply fork this repository and commit your own work to the correct folder.

```/<challenge name>/submissions/<Your discord username (including tag)>/```

Currently the .gitignore is incomplete, we will be adding various entries depending on what languages everyone decides to use in their submissions. **Please feel free to edit the .gitignore in your own forks as needed!**

On completing your work, submit a pull request to have it merged into the original repository! We will try to review as many submissions as possible.
